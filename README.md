# F1 Analytic Platform (Badger Stats ðŸ¦¡)

We do not have a permanent name for the project but for now it is called,
_Badger Stats ðŸ¦¡_ after my favorite F1 driver - Daniel Ricciardo.

## Scope

The project aims to provide data tools to the fans of F1 and Data Enthusiast to
run their own analysis on data from a F1 race weekend. In the future I would like
to implement way for the user of the platform to be able to share their analysis
dashboards.

For the initial stage of the project to be complete the following scopes need 
to be met:
+ [ ] Web App
+ [ ] Analysis Handbook
+ [ ] Different types of visualisation for different analysis
+ [ ] Giving use the ability to choose how they analyse the data
+ [ ] Ability to run analysis on Past and Current F1 seasons.

## Current Tech being used
1. Python
2. Dash
3. Plotly
4. Supabase (Open to other alternatives if they exist)

## Special Thanks

This project started off after being inspired by [u/Admired-Oregon's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/comments/12g7wxi/code_for_f1_data_viz_website_is_now_in_a_public/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
hence a special mention to that.
Apart from that this project wouldn't even have gotten off the ground without 
the open source project [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1).
